/*
Features:
    -Not Implemented: None


    -Implemented: command-line based program for user to be able to
    use command line for commands like creating, inserting, and selecting
    data from a file. To use the program user can either use interactive
    way to type his commands or even batch. Or he can use process batch funtction
    to process a batch of data in a text file.
    All the tables of records are stored in .tbl file and their
    field names are .txt files

    -Partly implemented: For SQL class I called the parser from inside
    each function

Bugs: implemented features are bug-free

Reflections:
    It was a challenging and also very creative program, the only problem that
    I had at first was that I added the field names into the .tbl file and
    I ended up having some troubles so I decided to use other option that you
    mentiond and put the field names in a .txt file
